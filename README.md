# Shuffler-Music
Web Music Player

We have used the spotify dataset and divided the songs and genres into clusters using K-Means unsupervised learning. We are using the previously listened songs of the user and according to the duration for which he hears the songs our recommendation system recommends songs to the user.
The main difference of the system is that we recommend the songs in a shuffled order such that the the next song recommended is the one the user most probably would have heard.

This is a cross platform application with a React frontend and Node backend with the use of Flask for handling the dataset. We also have created a mobile application with beautiful UI doing the same tasks but for Android and iOS using react native


## Getting Started

### React frontend

> npm start

### Node Backend

> npm run dev

### Flask 

> python -m flask run

## This is our web-UI using React.js
